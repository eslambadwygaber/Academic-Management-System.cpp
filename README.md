Academic Management System (C++ OOP)
Project Overview
A high-performance academic management application developed in C++ to demonstrate core Computer Science principles. This project showcases efficient data handling and object-oriented architecture for educational environments.

Technical Implementation
This system is built upon four pillars of software development:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism for a modular and scalable design.

Data Structures: Implements a manual Linked List using pointers to manage student records dynamically.

Memory Management: Features custom Destructors to ensure zero memory leaks during runtime.

Algorithmic Logic: Efficient search and record retrieval by unique identifiers.

Key Features
Dynamic Student Enrollment: Add and manage student profiles in real-time.

Polymorphic Data Display: Uniform interface for viewing diverse record types.

ID-based Search Engine: Instant lookup for academic records within the linked structure.

Safe Resource Handling: Explicit manual memory deallocation for optimized performance.

Core Concepts Demonstrated
Inheritance: Derived Student class from a base Person class.

Polymorphism: Implementation of virtual functions for extensible output.

Pointers & Memory: Direct heap management using new and delete operators.
